# BeruPipe
An upstream data parsing pipeline designed to remove XML structure and boilerplate from raw BERUFENET database extracts. Creates a simple data model that links description texts of multiple occupational dimensions to occupational and temporal metadata. Downstream, the data model can be used for text mining and feature extraction of BERUFENET data.
